### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **researcher in Machine Learning (ML)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, exploring how intelligent systems learn, reason, and adapt.  

My work focuses on bridging the gap between **theory and application**, contributing to both **academic research** and **practical implementations**.

ðŸ“š You can find my **published works** and the accompanying **code** right here in this repository.
